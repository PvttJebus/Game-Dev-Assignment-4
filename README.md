Game: Dust Busted

You play as a dust bunny trying to escape the clutches of the evil Roomba. You have a few seconds headstart before the Roomba activates and starts chasing you, don't doddle or the Roomba's going to get you. 

Controls: 
A = Left
D = Right 
Space = Jump 
- There's a 2-ish second time delay on jumps, so use them wisely

Game Concept
- Our initial thought was we wanted to do a platformer, as it's something that's relatively new to each of us and also seemed to be less complex than others. Rowen than had the idea of the dust bunny & Roomba concept.
